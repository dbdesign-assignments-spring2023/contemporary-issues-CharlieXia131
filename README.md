# The new trend of data-driven quantitative analysis in finance vs. Old fasion fundamental analysis
In this document, I will discuss two articles on the fast growing quantitative wave in financial analysis. One of the article support the rise of the new school while the other one defend the old approach of fundamental analysis.

## Article 1
The rapid development of computer and technology in recent decades gave rise to quantitative analysis in the financial industry. This approach use history data as its main source of information and optimize the investing strategy by putting data into different quantitative models. 

Ankur Chandra is certainly one of the supporter of this new approach to beat the market. In his article:[Human vs. Machine: The Next Frontier of Wealth Management](https://www.toptal.com/finance/stock-market-experts/quant-fund-performance), Chandra points out what he thinks is the edge of quantitative analysis. Since all the calculation, simulation, modeling, and decision making are performed by computer and AI, the strategy would be more rational and reliable with the powerful calculating power of machine. Moreover, the cost for financial institutions would also be lowered as less human capital is needed. 


## Article 2
Defending the old fashion fundamental analysis, the Australian scholar Greg Kaza
published his article [In defense of fundamental analysis: securities arbitrage and the efficient market theory](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225917682_In_defense_of_fundamental_analysis_securities_arbitrage_and_the_efficient_market_theory) in which he explained why the analysis of the fundemental situation of a company such as revenue, debt, profit, earnings per share, etc is still the way to outperform the market and could not be replaced by machine.

He claims that fundemental analysis is still the most efficient way to measure the intrinsic value of an asset. As for quantitative analysis, he thinks building analysis on past data is like trying to predict the future through the rearview mirror that historical data is in his opinion not sufficient of predicting future market activity no matter how powerful the models and machines are. Moreover, he thinks if tehe market is filled with quantitative investors, their strategy would eventually converge making it nearly immposible to outperform one another.
